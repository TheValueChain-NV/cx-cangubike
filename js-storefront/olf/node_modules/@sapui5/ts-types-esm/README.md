# @sapui5/ts-types-esm

This npm package contains the types signatures based on ES modules for all the SAPUI5 libraries.

These signatures can be used to:

1. Enable advanced content assist in IDEs, e.g: (VSCode / IntelliJ / Webstorm) for SAPUI5.
1. Integrate type checking for SAPUI5 applications using the TypeScript compiler.

These two capabilities are available both for SAPUI5 apps written in TypeScript **and** in JavaScript.

<b>NOTE:</b> "based on ES modules" means that the code needs to load UI5 modules using the ES6 modules syntax and then needs to be transformed to standard UI5 require/define syntax. Nevertheless, this is the recommended approach!<br>
See the "Usage" section below for links to detailed documentation about this setup.


## Usage

To see the suggested project setup for TypeScript development, please check out the [TypeScript Hello World app](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld). It not only can serve as copy template, but also includes a [detailed step-by-step guide](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/blob/main/step-by-step.md) for creating this setup from scratch.

The [TypeScript branch of the "UI5 CAP Event App"](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/tree/typescript) sample demonstrates a slightly more complex application, using the same setup. It comes with an [explanation](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/blob/typescript/docs/typescript.md) of what UI5 TypeScript code usually looks like and what to consider when writing such code.

For quick and easy scaffolding of a new UI5 app written in TypeScript, you can also use the easy-ui5 tool with the [generator-ui5-ts-app](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-ts-app) generator.
